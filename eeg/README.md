# Codes for EEG research
Used brain wave receivers to monitor the stimulation signals and recorded both stimulation signals and the signals in resting state about those healthy individuals and coma patients after a car accident. Trying to predict severity level of patients based on EEG data.

## Data-preprocessing
Using EEGlab and loadcurry toolbox in Matlab to process EEG data.
